# the-great-outdoors
This project is all about JavaScript and showcases my basic understanding of the languages' basic fundamentals through an outdoor directory website. A user has access to explore a variety of outdoor locations from mountains to National Parks through selection by drop-down menus on each page that'll display information about their desired and selected range.
Here is what that looks like:

This is my basic homepage with buttons directing the user to a directory

This is my mountain directory page with a dropdown menu for a user to select a specific mountain and display the information about that selected value

This is my national parks page with two dropdown menus for a user to select a specific park filtered by State or type of park that displays information about that selected value

Lastly, this is a piece of my code that I found the most interesting and difficult but felt very happy that I figured it out, understood it, and got it to work. It's function is to populate information based on user selection by taking and filtering it out from the array of multiple values.
